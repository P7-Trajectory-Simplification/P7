In order to conduct experiments on the trajectory simplification, choices regarding the number of 
trajectories and which error metrics should be reviewed have to be made. Regarding the amount of 
trajectories, we have evaluated that 200 trajectories should be analyzed, in order to ensure 
qualitative results. In the SQUISH paper, they analyzed 1300 trajectories, however, we evaluated that
200 trajectories would be sufficient, since any higher amount will only show small improvements
in the results. 

We have decided that the results should not be displayed as a table, since it will contain
a large amount of rows, and instead we will represent the results using graphs, with the
compression rate on the x-axis. The results which should be displayed in the report should be:
- The average PED and SED for each trajectory
- The compression ratio and how different compression ratios effect the PED and SED
- The computation time per point in a trajectory
- We have discussed looking at the memory usage when running an algorithm, however, these results
  might be hard to get and may not be of much importance.
